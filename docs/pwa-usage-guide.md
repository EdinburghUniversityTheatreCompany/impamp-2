# ImpAmp 2 PWA Usage Guide

ImpAmp 2 has been configured as a Progressive Web App (PWA), allowing you to install it on your device and use it offline.

## What is a PWA?

A Progressive Web App provides an app-like experience in a web browser:
- Works offline or with poor internet connections
- Can be installed on your device's home screen
- Loads quickly and reliably

## Installing ImpAmp 2 as a PWA

### On Desktop (Chrome, Edge, etc.)

1. Visit the ImpAmp 2 website
2. Look for the install prompt that appears in the bottom-right corner
3. Click "Install"
4. Alternatively, click the install icon in the browser's address bar (usually looks like a computer or mobile device with a down arrow)

### On Android

1. Visit the ImpAmp 2 website in Chrome
2. Tap the menu button (three dots) in the top-right corner
3. Select "Add to Home screen" or "Install App"
4. Follow the on-screen instructions

### On iOS (iPhone/iPad)

1. Visit the ImpAmp 2 website in Safari
2. Tap the Share button (rectangle with an arrow pointing up)
3. Scroll down and tap "Add to Home Screen"
4. Tap "Add" in the top-right corner

## Offline Usage

Once installed, ImpAmp 2 can be used without an internet connection:

- All your previously uploaded audio files will be available offline
- Your pad and bank configurations will be preserved
- Any changes made while offline will be saved locally

## Important Notes

- For first-time use, an internet connection is required to download the application files
- Large audio files may take longer to cache for offline use
- When you're online again, any updates to the app will be automatically applied

## Troubleshooting

If you experience issues with the PWA:

1. Make sure your browser is up to date
2. Clear your browser cache and reload the application
3. If the app stops working offline, try accessing it with an internet connection to update the cache
